- C :c:

I've been working as a developer for 1 years and have experience in Java Script

I don't have any open repository yet on my Github profile but I'll make one as soon I can!

If you'd like to connect with me, you can find me on Discord at [Typical Finney#1893](https://discordapp.com/). I'm always happy to chat and discuss programming or anything else that interests you.

Thanks for visiting my profile!
